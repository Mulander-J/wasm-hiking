# WASM Hiking ðŸ¥¾
> To master WebAssembly, or to falter in its mysteries, each step charts destiny's course.

## Applications
WebAssembly (Wasm) is a portable, high-performance binary format designed as a universal execution platform for web and non-web environments. It enables developers to run computationally intensive tasks more efficiently in web browsers and extend existing applications to other platforms and environments.

### Web Application Optimization
Wasm enhances the performance of web applications, particularly those requiring complex computations or high-performance graphics rendering, making them faster and more responsive in browsers.

### Cross-Platform Development
Wasm allows developers to write code once and run it anywhere. It runs on different operating systems and hardware architectures, offering flexibility for cross-platform development.

### Desktop Applications
Using Wasm, developers can convert existing desktop applications into WebAssembly modules, enabling them to run in web browsers without rewriting the entire application.

### Server-Side Applications
Wasm can be integrated into server-side applications to accelerate specific tasks such as data processing, machine learning model inference, and more.

### IoT Devices
Wasm can run on resource-constrained devices, providing an efficient execution environment that supports IoT device intelligence and interoperability.

## Supported Languages

WebAssembly can be developed using various programming languages, including but not limited to:
- C/C++
- Rust
- AssemblyScript (a TypeScript-like language compiled to Wasm)

Developers can choose the programming language that best suits their preferences and requirements.

## Hiking

### [AssemblyScript](https://www.assemblyscript.org/)
A TypeScript-like language for WebAssembly.
